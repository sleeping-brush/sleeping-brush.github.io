  <h1>about me</h1>
  <p>iâ€™m a painter of sleepy worlds, a writer of quiet verses, and a dreamer of warm skies and soft mornings.</p>
  <p>i study mechanical engineering, but my heart wanders through poetry, brush strokes, and small magic. i love matcha, rainy windows, the smell of old books, and long walks through silent cities.</p>
  <p>one day, i want to publish a book, build healing tech, and live slowly, with love, art, and honest people.</p>
  <p>thank you for visiting my quiet corner. ðŸŒ™</p>
